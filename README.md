# Websockets
Zach Schnell, Short Assignment 8

I added websockets and throttling on top of the express-babel-starter. On [a new branch from lab 3](https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52-17S/lab3-zchr/tree/websocket), I changed around the notes app to make use of the server in this repo. 

**Two notes**: 
1. Since I did not deploy, the client still has `socketserver = 'http://localhost:9090'`
2. For lab 3, I took advantage of Firebase's authentication. Since I wasn't going to recreate that in this short assignment, I branched from [an earlier commit](https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52-17S/lab3-zchr/commit/f439101d0ad11daea88dca13cc15d1d3a6f44a1f) (before I added auth). That is why GitHub says my branch `websocket` is a little bit behind master.
